# Rapptr Labs iOS Test

Rapptr Labs Test for Apprenticeship.  

LoginViewController UI was written entirely programatically.  

Animation takes SVG data and makes them UIBezierPaths to draw the logo to the screen.  This then allows me to add stroke, fills, and importantly animation to those properties.

CocoaPods was utilized, and the chosen Pod was SDWebImage.
